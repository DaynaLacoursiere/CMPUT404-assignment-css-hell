Part 1
------
- `dracula.html` and `vatsyayana.html` has inline styling, so I had to move my `<link>` to below it to allow it to overwrite theirs.

- Changed the background to #f1f1d4, a colour that more resembles parchment paper
- Changed the font-family of the entire page to a more rounded, larger font (Palatino)
- Increased the line-height of paragraphs to 1.5x for easier readability
- Added `mix-blend-mode: multiply` to images to remove white backgrounds
- Removed background color from `a` tags because why were they even there??
- Changed the color of links to brown so they don't stand out so distractingly
- Made the `p` font size a bit bigger
- Italicized `pre`
