              <p>
                I was born and lived in Edmonton until 6th grade when my family moved to Airdrie. I was a shy girl full of dreams to travel the world and experience all the incredible cultures it has to offer. In 11th grade I participated in my school's exchange program and moved to Nuremberg, Germany for 3 months. I learned all about German culture, and the experience only enhanced my wanderlust. In 2011 I returned to Edmonton to attend the University of Alberta. 
              </p>
              <p>
                I spent my first year of University studying Chemistry and English and quickly learning that Chemistry was not the right departement for me. In my second year I took my first Computing course and discovered a passion for problem solving and the magic that is programming, and immediately declared Computing as my major. I took the CMPUT 250 course and learned all about the intricacies of video game development, which caused me to set my sights on the Computer Game Development Certificate. The courses I took in my pursuit of this certificate helped me discover that my favourite part of computing is the visual aspect - typing a couple lines of code and seeing the results magically appear on the screen.
              </p>
              <p>
                In my fourth year I was accepted into the Science Internship Program. I applied to internships that focussed on the visual aspects of programming, primarily game development and web development. I caught the eye of the hiring team at Onlea Corporation. They emailed me asking why I would apply for their web developer position without any javascript, css, or html experience. They warned me that they would be testing my knowledge in the area at the interview, and told me that I wouldn't be able to pass the tests without some amount of experience. I told them that I had never used any web-based tools or languages, but that I am a fast learner and would study them before the interview, and they decided to give me a chance. Less than a week later, I astonished them by passing all of their tests and they decided to offer me the job. My internship at Onlea involved a steep learning curve and an impressive display of adaptability and personal growth. I came out of it a skilled web developer with experience in a wide variety of front- and back-end tools.
              </p>
              <p>
                I am now in my final year at the University of Alberta. I am the Vice President of the Video Game Art &amp; Design Club and I am spending my weekends helping young girls discover a passion for computing. I will be graduating this Spring and intend to pursue a career that will allow me to develop for the web and/or for games.
