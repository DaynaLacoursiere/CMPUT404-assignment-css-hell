                Hi, I'm Dayna. I'm a web developer, game enthusiast, baker, artist, optimist, and creative writer. I am in my final year of a bachelors degree, and in the past 6 <small>(yes 6)</small> years of University, I have learned a <i>lot</i> about myself.
              </p>
              <p>
                For example, when I enrolled at the University of Alberta I intended to major in Chemistry and minor in English. I will be graduating with a Computing Science Specialization. Six years ago I was a shy introvert with her nose in a book avoiding the public eye; now I'm the Vice President of the <a href="http://vgad.org">Video Game Art &amp; Design Club</a>, I instruct a coding class of 20+ young girls with <a href="http://discovere.ualberta.ca/">DiscoverE</a>, and I helped found, manage, and grow the Edmonton <a href="http://www.gdxedmonton.com/">Game Discovery Exhibition</a>.
              </p>
              <p>
                In my third year at the University I took a course called CMPUT 250 - otherwise known as Computers &amp; Games. Not only did this course help me discover a passion for games and game development, it also introduced me to the Video Game Art &amp; Design Club. Through the course and the club I developed my interpersonal skills, came out of my shell, and realized that game development allows my creative and logical sides to work together and produce magic. I also discovered that my favourite part of computing is the visual aspect - typing a couple lines of code and seeing the results magically appear on the screen.
              </p>
              <p>
                In my fourth year I was accepted into the Science Internship Program. I applied to internships that focussed on the visual aspects of programming, primarily game development and web development. I caught the eye of the hiring team at <a href="http://onlea.org">Onlea Corporation</a>, and they emailed me asking why I would apply for their web developer position without any javascript, css, or html experience. They warned me that they would be testing my knowledge in the area at the interview, and that I wouldn't be able to pass the tests without some level of experience. I told them that I had never used any web-based tools or languages, but that I am a fast learner and would study them before the interview, and they decided to give me a chance. Less than a week later, I astonished them by passing all of their tests and they decided to offer me the job. My internship at Onlea involved a steep learning curve and an impressive display of adaptability and personal growth. I came out of it a skilled web developer with experience in a wide variety of front- and back-end tools.
              </p>
              <p>
                I am now in my final year at the University of Alberta. I will be graduating this Spring and intend to pursue a career that will allow me to develop eiher for the web and/or for games. At Onlea I got a brief taste of gamifying education and I am eager to explore the area further. By the end of this year I will have received the University's <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/interdisciplinary-studies/computer-game-development">Certificate in Computer Game Development</a>. In completing the courses required for this certificate I have studied games, game theory, and game history; learned about a variety of game applications and mechanics; and developed numerous games under various levels of restraint. 
              </p>
